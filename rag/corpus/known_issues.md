# Known Issues

1. Late ingestion:
If SKU-level data arrives late, daily totals or breakdowns may be temporarily incomplete.
Freshness tables should be checked to confirm arrival times.

2. Missing SKU feed:
If a SKU disappears from the SKU-level table for a day, the daily KPI can drop.
Compare recent SKUs vs yesterday to detect missing SKUs.
